###### Stack
LIFO(Last In, First Out)

###### Queue
FIFO(First In, First Out)

###### Linked list
A linked list store a collection of data elements dynamically 

##### Non-Linear Data Structures
The data are not placed sequentially or linearly. The elements point to multiples other elements.

###### Tree
It contains a collection of nodes in a hierarchy, which every node parent has other 1 or 2 children, and so on for each child

###### Graph
It contains a finite number of nodes or vertices and the edges connecting them
