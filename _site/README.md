# A BLOG ABOUT PROGRAMMING

Each person has his own method to keep your knowledge in the permanent memory. I realized that my method is writing what I learning. Normally I do that in a notebook but I'm a tech girl, so, why not try on my own blog? Besides I can share what I learned. 
I'm in my path of learning english and programming. That way I'm practice both of my discoveries :)
I hope this can help someone in some way.

Cheers!
Bruna Alves.
